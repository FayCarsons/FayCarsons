# Hi! üëãüèª
My name is Fay Carsons :3 <br>
I'm a programmer, musician, and generative artist in Richmond, Virginia. <br>
I've been teaching myself computer science for the last two years. <br> 
My GitHub is a record of my progress, from my first scripts to current projects <br>

# Previous projects:
[Hollow](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/hollow) - A Clojurescript library for writing WebGL shaders with a meta-programmable DSL, a featured library of shader utilities, and high-level abstractions over the WebGL API.

# Currently working on: 
[The Odoc parser](https://github.com/FayCarsons/odoc) - A full rewrite of the parser that drives Odoc, OCaml's library documentation tooling. 
[OCaml ecosystem](https://github.com/FayCarsons/OCaml-monome) - Continuing projects to expand the OCaml ecosystem's support for creative coding, focusing on graphics and DSP.
