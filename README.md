Hi ! My name is Fay :~) 
I am a musician, synthesist, programmer, n00b....
in short I create things that, ideally, bring people pleasure.
So I am learning how to craft these things in a way that makes them particularly exciting.
That goal has led me to computer science.
Here you will find projects relevant to either
1. music production
2. CS education

I hope you find them helpful, or at least interesting :)

thanks!
Fay
