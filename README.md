# Hi! üëãüèª
My name is Fay Carsons :) <br>
I am a programmer, musician, and generative artist in Richmond, Virginia. <br>
I began teaching myself computer science two years ago <br> 
My github is a record of my progress including some of the first code I wrote, all the way up to current projects in production. <br>
I am currently looking for work in front-end, backend-end, or full-stack!
