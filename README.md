# Hi! üëãüèª
My name is Fay Carsons :3 <br>
I'm a programmer, musician, and generative artist in Richmond, Virginia. <br>
I've been teaching myself computer science for the last 3 years. <br> 
My GitHub is a record of my progress. <br>

# Previous projects:
[Hollow](https://github.com/Ella-Hoeppner/hollow) - A Clojurescript library for writing WebGL shaders with a meta-programmable DSL, a featured library of shader utilities, and high-level abstractions over the WebGL API. <br>

[Cables.gl - Faust integration](https://github.com/FayCarsons/Cables-Faust-Plugin) - A plugin for the Cables.gl (A Max-MSP like visual DSP language) ecosystem that enables users to livecode Faust DSP programs, compiling them to WASM Web Audio nodes with control from other Cables operators.<br>
